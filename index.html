        <p>The more and more days pass by we are leaving a part of ourselves. That is what makes us care for people and give
            a helping hand to thos in need. Nowadays most people see something that shouldn't be happening bu we don't do
            anything about it we either watch, walk away or worst record and post it on social media for everybody to see.
            These actions that we take could take someone or something life away in an instant. Who will stay with that 
            blame you and the person who caused it.
